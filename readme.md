## Overview

This a websocket _client_ (not server!) implementation written in pure Clojure. It was created because _every_ JVM websocket implementation I could find sucked horribly and was unusable for my needs.

This was written years ago, but I only got around to publishing it now. I don't have the Clojure development setup necessary to test this and publish this as a proper package, so instead it's just files ripped out from an application where this was used. You're free to adapt this to your own app, or even republish as a library, ideally with proper credit attribution.
